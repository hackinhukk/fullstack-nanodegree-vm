Setting up the database.
Once you are in your vagrant machine and have typed in
the command cd /vagrant, you are now ready to setup the database.
First, type in """python database_setup.py""".  Then after this file has been run, type in """python catalogitems.py""".  Once you see the message "added catalog items!" appear on your vagrant terminal, then you will know the initial configuration of the database has worked.
